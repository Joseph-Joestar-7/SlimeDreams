  - "Ah\u2026 another wanderer. You\u2019ve taken quite the strange form, haven\u2019t
    you? A little slime\u2026 trapped in your own dream."
  - "See that shimmer above you? That\u2019s your Lucidity. It\u2019s the only thing
    keeping you aware that this is a dream. Lose it all, and you\u2019ll sink deeper\u2026
    until you forget yourself completely"
  - "I can show you the way forward\u2026 but knowledge isn\u2019t free. Bring me
    the dream coins scattered here, and I\u2019ll open the path."
  - And beware the plants. They hunger, and even slime is not beyond their reach.
